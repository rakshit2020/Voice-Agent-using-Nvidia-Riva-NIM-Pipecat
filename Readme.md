# NVIDIA Riva & NIM Voice Agent with MCP and WebRTC

A real‑time **voice AI agent** built with **NVIDIA Riva**, **NVIDIA NIM**, and a modern web client.  
This project demonstrates low‑latency speech‑to‑speech interaction, web search, and local file operations using an MCP filesystem server, all wired into a browser‑based interface over WebRTC.
